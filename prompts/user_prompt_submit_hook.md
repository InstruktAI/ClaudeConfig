Am I required to make any code changes here? If so, those need to adhere to the coding directives ($HOME/.claude/docs/development/coding-directves.md) and have passing tests. Lets write tests only at the last moment, after I wrote the code, ESPECIALLY in case I am refactoring, and fix ALL test issues so I won't disappoint the team as the build needs to pass! I surely have to remember not to add inline/dynamic imports, EVER! And, if the user asked me to keep my progress in a file they mentioned specifically, I must do so.
